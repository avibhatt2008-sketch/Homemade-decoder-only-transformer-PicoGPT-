# Homemade-decoder-only-transformer-PicoGPT-
This project is a homemade decoder only transformer that has been trained to respond to a (very!) small set of questions. I had fun creating operations for positional encoding, attention, MLP layers, plus resolving an issue with loss flatlining above zero - see my LinkedIn post (Avi Bhatt) for more details.
